# Core ML/DL
torch==2.6.0
# torchvision and torchaudio are often installed with torch, but not directly imported.
# If specific features are used or for environment consistency, keep them.
# For now, commenting them out as direct imports are not visible.
# torchvision==0.21.0
# torchaudio==2.6.0
transformers>=4.46.0
peft # Often used with transformers for specific model types/optimizations
accelerate # For transformers device_map="auto" and other optimizations

# Speech Synthesis
chatterbox-tts>=0.1.2 # Handles its own sub-dependencies like librosa, soundfile, scipy

# WebRTC and Async Web Server
aiohttp>=3.9.0 # For the web server and WebSocket handling
aiortc>=1.5.0  # For WebRTC peer connection and media tracks
PyAV>=10.0.0   # For aiortc audio/video frame manipulation (explicitly AudioFrame)

# Numerical Processing (often a sub-dependency, but good to specify a minimum)
numpy>=1.26.0

# Note: SileroVAD is loaded via torch.hub, no separate PyPI package needed.
# Removed: librosa, scipy, huggingface-hub, soundfile (handled by chatterbox-tts or transformers)
# Removed: websockets (aiohttp handles WebSockets)
# Removed: fastrtc (preferring explicit aiortc and other direct dependencies)
